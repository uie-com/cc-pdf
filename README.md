# PDF Link Service

The **PDF Link Service** is a lightweight web app that generates **permalinked PDFs** from Google Docs.  
Each PDF is automatically kept up to date ‚Äî whenever you open the PDF link, you see the latest version of its source document.


## üß≠ Overview

This service provides a permanent PDF link for any Google Doc. The links act as live mirrors ‚Äî instead of storing static copies, they fetch the newest version of the Google Doc and serve it as a downloadable PDF on request.

Google Docs will provide PDF copies of documents, but only in a custom viewer that cannot be accessed in certain environments.

**Example use cases:**
- Sharing documents to government or restricted networking environments.
- Embedding live-updating PDFs in dashboards or newsletters.
- Automating PDF distribution workflows from collaborative documents.


## ‚ú® Features

- **Dynamic PDFs** ‚Äì Always up-to-date exports from linked Google Docs.
- **Simple API** ‚Äì Create and retrieve PDF links programmatically.
- **Serverless hosting** ‚Äì Runs as a Next.js app on Netlify.
- **Automation-ready** ‚Äì Works seamlessly with no manual maintenance.


## üåê How It Works

1. **Create a Link**  
   The service stores a mapping between a unique PDF ID and the corresponding Google Doc URL.

2. **View the PDF**  
   When a PDF is accessed, the service:
   - Looks up the Google Doc by its stored ID.
   - Generates a PDF on the fly using Google Docs‚Äô native export feature.
   - Streams the resulting file to the browser.

3. **Automatic Updates**  
   Since each view fetches directly from Google Docs, no manual updates are required. The PDF always reflects the most recent version.


## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uie-com/cc-pdf
cd cc-pdf
npm install
```

### 2. Development

Run locally with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

By default, the app runs on `http://localhost:3000`.

### 3. Environment Variables

You‚Äôll need to configure the following environment variables in a `.env.local` file:

| Variable | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `AIRTABLE_TOKEN` | Access token for the Airtable database that stores PDF mappings |
| `PUBLIC_URL` | The base URL for your local or deployed instance |
| `CREATE_WEBHOOK_URL` | (Optional) Webhook URL to notify when a PDF is created |
| `EDIT_WEBHOOK_URL` | (Optional) Webhook URL to notify when a PDF is edited |
| `NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_URL` | (Optional) Webhook for daily PDF summaries |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Reminder:** These values must never be committed to source control.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture

**Core components:**

| Component | Purpose |
|------------|----------|
| **Next.js App** | API routes `/view` and `/notify` |
| **Airtable Database** | Stores document mappings and metadata |
| **Google Docs Export API** | Provides live PDF export |
| **Webhooks** | Sends notifications to external services (e.g., Slack, email, or chat tools) |
| **Cron Job (Optional)** | Automates daily PDF summaries |

## üß† Airtable Schema

The service relies on a single Airtable base (table) with the following fields:

| Field Name | Type | Description |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| `Name` | **Single line text** | Unique ID for each PDF, formatted like `YYYY-MM-DD Report Title` |
| `Docs URL` | **URL** | The full Google Docs link that will be converted to a PDF |
| `PDF URL` | **URL** _(optional)_ | The generated permalink served by this service |

**Table Behavior:**
- The `Name` field acts as the unique key.
- The `/view` API creates or updates records based on `Name`.
- The `/notify` API queries for records with today‚Äôs date prefix (e.g., `2025-10-09`).


## üß† API Reference

### Create a PDF Link

**Endpoint:**  
`POST /view`

**Body Parameters:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `url` | `string` | The Google Docs URL to link |
| `name` | `string` | A unique identifier for the PDF (e.g., `2025-06-03_Metrics_Report`) |
| `message` | `boolean` | Optional. Whether to trigger webhook notifications |

**Response:**
Returns a JSON object containing the permalink to the new PDF.


### View a PDF

**Endpoint:**  
`GET /view?q=<PDF_ID>`

Example:  
`https://pdf.company.com/view?q=2025-06-03_Metrics_Report`

Returns the live-updated PDF file corresponding to the stored document.

### Send a Daily Report
Sends a summary webhook with a list of PDFs that are marked with today's date. Can be used for easy access to daily or event-specific documents. Requires document IDs begin with the format "YYYY-MM-DD".

**Endpoint:**  
`GET /notify`

**Purpose**
- Queries Airtable for all records whose `{Name}` starts with today‚Äôs date (e.g. `2025-10-09`).  
- Posts each record to a webhook endpoint (`NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_URL`).

**Response:**
'Notifications sent successfully' or 'No records found for today'

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Deployment:** [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- **Database:** [Airtable](https://airtable.com/)
- **PDF Source:** Google Docs Export API

**Flow summary:**
1. `POST /view` ‚Üí creates or updates a link record in Airtable.  
2. `GET /view?q=...` ‚Üí fetches the Google Docs PDF export.  
3. Optional integrations (Zapier, cron jobs, webhooks) handle automation.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Integrations

The service can integrate with third-party tools for automation:

- **Zapier / Make.com:** Automatically generate or update PDF links when Google Docs change.  
- **Cron Jobs:** Schedule daily summaries or sync checks.  
- **Slack / Email Webhooks:** Notify teams when new PDFs are generated.

> These integrations are optional ‚Äî the core app functions independently.

## üîî Webhook Integrations

Webhooks are optional and triggered automatically when records are **created**, **updated**, or **summarized**.

### Create Webhook (`CREATE_WEBHOOK_URL`)
Triggered after a new link is created.

**Payload Example**
```json
{
  "name": "2025-06-03 Metrics Topic 4",
  "doc": "https://docs.google.com/document/d/123abc/edit",
  "url": "https://pdf.company.com/view?q=2025-06-03-metrics-topic-4"
}
```

---

### Edit Webhook (`EDIT_WEBHOOK_URL`)
Triggered after a link is updated (same name, new Google Doc URL).

**Payload Example**
```json
{
  "name": "2025-06-03 Metrics Topic 4",
  "doc": "https://docs.google.com/document/d/456def/edit",
  "url": "https://pdf.company.com/view?q=2025-06-03-metrics-topic-4"
}
```

---

### Notify Webhook (`NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_URL`)
Triggered daily via `/notify`, once per record created today.

**Payload Example**
```json
{
  "name": "Metrics Topic 4",
  "docLink": "https://docs.google.com/document/d/123abc/edit",
  "pdfLink": "https://pdf.company.com/view?q=2025-06-03-metrics-topic-4"
}
```

**Expected Response**
A `200 OK` acknowledgment from the receiving service is sufficient.  
No retry logic is built in; use an external job monitor if reliability is required.


## üí° Example Use

If you store project notes or reports in Google Docs, you can use the PDF Link Service to generate public-facing permalinks. Each link behaves like a ‚Äúlive PDF snapshot‚Äù ‚Äî perfect for sharing or downloading for further automation.

Example workflow:
1. Add your Google Doc to the system.
2. The service returns a unique PDF permalink.
3. Anyone with the link can open or download the always-updated PDF.

OR

1. A polling Zapier automation searches for new Docs links in a database
2. It makes an API call to this service and stores the new link
3. The database now always has a direct access link
